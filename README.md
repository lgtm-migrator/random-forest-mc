This project is about use Random Forest approach to credit card fraud detection [3]. Based on [1], random forest approach have interesting results in this issue. Moreover, random forest approach offers opportunities for customization to achieve better results for issues with particularities. In this project, we have a customized method of Random Forest using a dynamic tree selection Monte Carlo based. The first implementation is found in [2] (using Common Lisp).

### Structure

- **EDA**: Using [Pandas Profiling](https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/docs/master/index.html) for take a look into the data. [Notebook](./EDA.ipynb).

- **Feat. Analysis**: Transforming the data into representations for minor time and space complexity. [Notebook](./Feat_Eng.ipynb). 

- **Baseline Prediction Model**: Experiments using [Random Forest from Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html). [Notebook](./Baseline_Model.ipynb).

- **Customized Prediction Model**: Random forest custimized with a dynamic tree selection Monte Carlo based. [Notebook](./Customized_Model.ipynb).

### Notes

- Python requirements in `requirements.txt`. Better for Python `>=3.7`. Run the follow command inside this repository:

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir
```

### Development Framework (optional)

- [My data science Docker image](https://github.com/ysraell/my-ds).

With this image you can run all notebooks and scripts Python inside this repository.

### TODO:

- Feature importance analysis comparing the customized and baseline models.
